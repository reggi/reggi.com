This is a calendar created for a [group collaboration project](http://reggi.github.io/csi-calendar/) each student in the class was given a month and with 15 students we constructed a 15 month calendar. I personally chose the month that I worked on December 21, 2012.

This calendar is based on the idea that the world could possibly end on December 21, 2012. I took this idea and thought about the numerous astronomical doomsday scenarios that could take place. I wanted to keep the design minimalist and feed of the aesthetic of old renaissance notebook drawings.

I chose this month because it is a month that can easily tell a story due to the prediction that “armageddon” could possibly occur. Specifically December 21, 2012 is the day the Mayan calendar ends. My illustration reflects this idea of the world coming to an end and greatly and expands upon it. When I think of doomsday scenarios I think of massive celestial catastrophes.
