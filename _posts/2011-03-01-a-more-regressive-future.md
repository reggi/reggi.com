Representations of “the future” tend to be false. The very nature of depicting “the future” is not to mention impossible but also foolish, because no one can accurately know what the future will look like. This is not to say that images and depictions of the future are irrelevant. Depictions of the future are usually defined by the period in which the depiction was conceived.

To quote the synopsis of my favorite movie [_Blade Runner_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/):

> In a cyberpunk vision of the future, man has developed the technology to create replicants, human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth but with fixed lifespans.

I have depicted my own vision of a future, in which the earth is literally a machine and its inhabitants are literally living in an environment which is machinelike. The aesthetic I have used is that of steampunk, rather than displaying high-tech electronics (ex. printed circuit boards) I use brass cogs, bicycle chain, pistons, and physical industrial machinery, implying that the world (ie. capitalism) is a “well oiled machine”. The use of stream era iconography also implies a regression in technology.I also play on the idea of urban decay. Images of industrialization, and automation have be conveyed with repetition.
