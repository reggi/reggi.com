> Update: This project used to be located at [reggi.com/projects/age](http://reggi.com/projects/age) but with my recent switch from wordpress / codeigniter to jekyll this project has been lost, revival pending.

This is a simple web page that asks one simple question _“How old are you?”_. Simply enter your birthdate and you will see exactly how old you are!

The driving force behind this site, was that I wanted to know exactly how old I was at any given second, implying that you aren’t ever one particular age and one particular time.

Society also clings to the anual increment for how old a person is, not thinking about seconds, hours, or weeks. We are also not reminded that if someone is 21 years old, they are 21 Earth years old, and not, lets say Neptune years.
