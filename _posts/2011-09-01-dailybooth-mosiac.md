> _Update_: Dailybooth.com shut down in early 2013, and it got more difficult to keep up with managing and maintaining pictures. I've since stopped taking my picture's daily.

I take a picture of myself everyday. I have been doing this for well over a year now. To me it is a ritual that I partake in everyday. I believe in digital preservation, and the immortalization of yourself through images. In addition to all of this I adore large scale data, and I find it easy to simply take a picture every day, which has accumulated to a large amount of data.

The use of the website / social network [dailybooth.com](http://dailybooth.com/) has led me to create this project which I call “Dailybooth Mosiac”. At its core it is a single page with every image I have taken. This was very technically challenging, mainly because loading over 600 images on one page is very time consuming, I have developed a way which deals mainly with generating spritesheets of all of my images

I would like to thank the people over at [dailybooth.com](http://dailybooth.com/) for access to their intuitive (yet buggy) API. I would also like to thank some of the geniuses who answered some of my questions over at [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/).
