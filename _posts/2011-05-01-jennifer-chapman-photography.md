[jchapmanphotography.com][] is a website I created displaying the
photographic work of Jennifer Chapman. As a world class photographer
Jennifer came to me with the urge to create a web portfolio consisting
of her numerous photographic projects. Each project consists of multiple
images and each project consists of a description.

The challenge of creating a dynamic and easy to use website was solved
by creating a custom [CMS][] for Jennifer. The [CMS][] I created for
this project was greatly inspired by [Stacy][]. Creating a custom
framework was very beneficial because  I could taylor make it for a
photography gallery, unlike most text based CMS which are designed with
blogging in mind.
